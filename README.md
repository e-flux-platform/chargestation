## Setup

### Run in Docker

Todo

## Development

### Directory Structure

- `package.json` - Configure dependencies
- `webpack.config.js` - Bundling and build configuration
- `.env` - Enviroment variables
- `src/components` - Home of reuseable components
- `src/utils` - Home of specific JS helper utilities
- `src/index.html` - Main entrypoint into App UI (Webpack injected)
- `serve/static.js` - Static server
- `serve/dev.js` - Static server for development
- `dist/*` - Files generated by webpack, incuding index.html. These are the
  assets that should be HTTP served

### Install Dependencies

Ensure Node.js version uniformity using Volta:

```
curl -sSLf https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

Install dependencies: (will install correct Node.js version)

```
yarn install
```

### Run

The following command serves all HTML/JS/CSS and watches all changes to
`src/*.js`

```bash
yarn start
```

UI is running at [http://localhost:2100/](http://localhost:2100/)

### Configuration

All configuration is done using environment variables. The default values in
`.env` can be overwritten using environment variables.

- `SERVER_HOST` - Host to bind to, defaults to `"0.0.0.0"`
- `SERVER_PORT` - Port to bind to, defaults to `2300`
- `HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_PATH` - Basic Auth: Path to protect
- `HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_USER` - Basic Auth: Username
- `HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_PASS` - Basic Auth: Password
- `ENV_NAME` - Node environment `development`
- `APP_NAME` - Default product name to be used in views
- `API_URL` - URL for API defaults to `http://localhost:2300`
- `SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry error monitoring credentials

All config vars are available in the `serve/dev.js` and `serve/static.js`
server-side code. In the browser-side all variables are available as a global
object `window.__env_conf`.
